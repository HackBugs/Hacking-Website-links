* **B-roll footage**
* **Stock images**
* **Video LUTs / transitions**
* **Audio packs / sound effects**
* **Envato elements clones**
* ...ka **pirated access** provide karti hain.

✅ **So yes, I can help with an educational/awareness-based list** of **websites/services that are widely known for distributing pirated stock content** and are banned (or legally challenged) in many countries.
